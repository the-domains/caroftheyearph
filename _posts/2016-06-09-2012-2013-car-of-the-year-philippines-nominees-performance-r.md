March 22, 2013

As some of you might already know, one aspect used to determine a new Car of the Year Philippines (COTY-P) are the results gathered from the Technical Test performed at the Clark International Speedway (CIS). And for the 2012 - 2013 edition, all 80 nominees had to subjected to acceleration (0 to 100 km/h), braking (100 to 0 km/h), and handling (slalom) tests.

Although the Technical Tests have been performed every year since the award-giving body was formed, this is the very first time we could remember that the Car Awards Group Inc. (CAGI) published the official performance results for public viewing. Not only will this help in guiding consumers choose which car to buy, but it will finally put to rest claims of which one's the fastest.

All nominated vehicles were repeatedly driven by qualified performance drivers to get the best results. Official times and figures were then measured using a Racelogic VBOX, which uses GPS to track data, to get the most accurate figures.

Top Performers

It doesn't come as a surprise that the fastest vehicle on the list is the 2013 Hyundai Genesis Coupe 3.8L V6\. Packing 303 hp and a new eight-speed automatic transmission, the best we could get was a 7.1 second time in the sprint to 100 km/h. Its Brembo package-equipped 2.0L turbo brother, on the other hand, had the shortest 100 to 0 km/h braking distance of 37.5 meters, which was equalled by the MINI Roadster Cooper S and get this, the Peugeot 5008 MPV. Likewise, the handling test was aced yet again by the Genesis Coupe 3.8L V6 with a time of 10.3 seconds.

So where's the much hyped about Toyota 86? The manual transmission version was able to reach 100 km/h in 8.2 seconds, stop in 39.5 meters, and finish the slalom in 10.9 seconds. Close, but no cigar.

On the eve of April 4, 2013 at the Manila International Auto Show (MIAS), there will be a newly-crowned Car of the Year Philippines (COTY-P) for 2012 - 2013\.

Of the 80 vehicles listed, which one do you think will be the 2012 - 2013 Philippine Car of the Year?
