March 20, 2013

After spending nine days for Qualitative Tests at ETON Centris, Quezon City and another four days for Technical Tests at the Clark International Speedway (CIS), it all comes down to this. On the eve of April 4, 2013 at the Manila International Auto Show (MIAS), there will be a newly-crowed Car of the Year Philippines (COTY-P) for 2012 - 2013\. But before last year's COTY - the Hyundai Elantra - hands over its throne, the Car Awards Group Inc. (CAGI) has published this year's final nominees.

The list includes 80 vehicles competing in 20 Categories, plus the coveted Car of the Year Philippines title. But new for this year is a Truck of the Year Philippines (TOTY-P) award that separately recognizes the bigger cars in the bunch.

In case you're wondering, the categories are re-evaluated on a yearly basis as the selection itself changes. They're grouped according to size, displacement, price point, and drivetrain. Also note that only all-new or mechanically updated models qualify for each edition of the Car of the Year Philippines.
