  In 2004, motoring editors from some of the most respected publications in the
  country banded together to form the Car Awards Group Incorporated with the
  sole objective of spurring industry growth in the automotive sector by
  informing the motoring public of the industry's many excellent products thru
  the Car of the Year Awards. Since then, the organization has grown to
  encompass over 50 members from the nation's leading broadcast, print and
  online media outlets. Testing procedures have also been refined to consider
  the needs, wants and preferences of the car buying public as well as absolute
  performance characteristics of each newly introduced vehicle every year.
